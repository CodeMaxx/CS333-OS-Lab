In case of priority based scheduler, the processes finish in decreasing order of priority i.e. the one with maximum priority finishes first. This is expected since maximum priority process always gets scheduled. In case of constant priority for all children, my exit output is in increasing order of PID. This is because now all children have equal priority and according to my algorithm the first one with maximum priority gets scheduled first. Since there are small number of processes, the ptables has them in order of increasing PID and hence the result is increasing pid exit order.

In the case of round-robin scheme, mostly the processes with higher priority get finished first. This is because they get higher run time. The order is not exact because it depends on which process get scheduled how many times. This is also the case when we have 20 children, the order is not exact.
